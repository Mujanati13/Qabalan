```
1. Create test orders with:
   - Multiple items
   - Variants and discounts
   - Status changes
   - Complete delivery addresses
   - Special instructions

2. Export and verify:
   - All order fields are present
   - Items sheet contains all products
   - Status history shows all changes
   - No data overlap between sheets
   - Addresses display correctly
```

**Support Tickets Test**:
```
1. Create test tickets with:
   - Multiple conversation messages
   - File attachments
   - Status changes
   - Internal notes

2. Export and verify:
   - All ticket fields populated
   - Conversations sheet complete
   - No missing messages
   - Performance metrics calculated
```

**Customers Test**:
```
1. Test with customers having:
   - Multiple addresses
   - Order history
   - Various statuses

2. Export and verify:
   - All customer fields present
   - Addresses sheet complete
   - Order history accurate
   - No duplicate data
```

### 2. Performance Testing

```
1. Test with large datasets:
   - 100+ orders with items
   - 50+ support tickets with conversations
   - 200+ customers with addresses

2. Monitor:
   - Export completion time
   - Memory usage
   - File size
   - Browser responsiveness
```

### 3. Data Integrity Testing

```
1. Verify exported data matches database:
   - Cross-check random samples
   - Verify calculations (totals, counts)
   - Check date formatting
   - Validate currency formatting

2. Test edge cases:
   - Orders with no items
   - Customers with no addresses
   - Tickets with no conversations
   - Missing or null values
```

### 4. Excel File Structure Testing

```
1. Open exported files in Excel/LibreOffice
2. Verify:
   - Multiple sheets created correctly
   - Column headers present
   - Data formatting preserved
   - No Excel errors or warnings
   - Auto-sized columns readable
```

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Network Failures**: Graceful degradation with retry mechanisms
- **Data Fetch Errors**: Individual record failures don't stop entire export
- **Memory Issues**: Chunked processing for large datasets
- **File Generation Errors**: Clear error messages to users

## Backward Compatibility

The enhanced export system maintains backward compatibility:
- Existing CSV/PDF exports still available in "Legacy" options
- API endpoints unchanged
- Export configurations preserved
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Export utilities loaded only when needed
2. **Batch Processing**: Large datasets processed in chunks
3. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup after export completion
4. **User Feedback**: Loading indicators and progress messages

## Dependencies

- **xlsx**: For Excel file generation
- **antd**: For UI components and messages
- **dayjs**: For date formatting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Export Button Disabled**: Check if data is available
2. **Large File Downloads**: Wait for loading indicator to complete
3. **Excel Won't Open**: Ensure xlsx library is properly installed
4. **Missing Data**: Verify API responses include required fields

### Debug Information:

The system includes console logging for development:
- Export progress tracking
- Data fetch results
- Error details
- Performance metrics

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. **Real-time Export Progress**: Progress bars for large exports
2. **Export Scheduling**: Automated periodic exports
3. **Custom Field Selection**: User-configurable export fields
4. **Export Templates**: Predefined export configurations
5. **Cloud Storage Integration**: Direct export to cloud services

The comprehensive export system provides:
- ✅ Complete data with no overlap or mixing
- ✅ Multiple sheet organization for related data
- ✅ Proper Excel formatting and structure
- ✅ Enhanced user experience with dropdown options
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing features
- ✅ Robust error handling and performance optimization

This implementation resolves the original issues of incomplete exports and data overlap while providing a significantly enhanced user experience.
