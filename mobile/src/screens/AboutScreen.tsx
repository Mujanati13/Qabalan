      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Qabalan Bakeries was established in 1995 as a small family business. We entered the
        food industry inspired to make a difference in the market, and our mission was simple:
        to create high-quality bread and delicious pastries at a reasonable price. With years
        of hard work, passion, innovation and dedication, Qabalan Bakeries has become known
        across the Jordanian market as one of the unique bakeries. Moreover, our products have
        become favoured among several countries in the Middle East; thus, we have proudly
        expanded our sales in global supermarkets across the East and West.
