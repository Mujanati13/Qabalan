# 📋 Delivery Fee Test Scripts - Summary

## ✅ What Was Created

I've created **3 test scripts** to verify your delivery fee calculation system works correctly with real Jordan locations:

### 1. **test-delivery-calculation.js** (⭐ RECOMMENDED)
**Most comprehensive and informative**

```bash
node test-delivery-calculation.js
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Tests 10 real Jordan locations (Amman, Zarqa, Irbid, Aqaba, etc.)
- ✅ Shows distance calculations (expected vs actual)
- ✅ Fee breakdown (base + distance charges)
- ✅ Free shipping threshold testing
- ✅ Statistical analysis (min/max/average fees)
- ✅ Zone distribution report
- ✅ Detects configuration issues
- ✅ Validates branch coordinates

**Output includes:**
- System configuration (branches, zones)
- Branch location verification
- Detailed calculation for each test location
- Free shipping threshold tests with multiple order amounts
- Summary with fee ranges and zone distribution

---

### 2. **test-delivery-fee-quick.js**
**Quick verification test**

```bash
node test-delivery-fee-quick.js
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Simple 8-location test
- ✅ Fast execution
- ✅ Order amount scenarios
- ✅ Good for quick checks

---

### 3. **test-delivery-fee-real-locations.js**
**Extended comprehensive test**

```bash
node test-delivery-fee-real-locations.js
```

**Features:**
- ✅ 16 test destinations
- ✅ Multiple order amounts (0-250 JOD)
- ✅ Nearest branch detection
- ✅ Accuracy metrics
- ✅ Detailed reporting

---

## 🎯 Test Results Interpretation

### ✅ **What the Tests Validate:**

1. **Distance Calculation** - Haversine formula working correctly
2. **Zone Assignment** - Correct shipping zone based on distance
3. **Fee Calculation** - Proper formula: `Base Price + (Distance × Per KM Rate)`
4. **Free Shipping** - Thresholds applied correctly when order amount qualifies
5. **System Integration** - Database queries and service layer working

### ⚠️ **Current Issue Detected:**

Your test run showed:
```
Branch: Main Branch
Location: 33.89380000, 35.50180000
Address: Beirut, Lebanon
```

**Problem:** Branch coordinates are in **Lebanon**, not Jordan!

All test locations are 150-500km away, exceeding the 100km max delivery distance, so they all fall into the "Default Zone" with flat 5 JOD fee.

## 🔧 How to Fix for Accurate Testing

### Update Branch Coordinates to Jordan

**Option 1: Update existing branch**
```sql
-- Set to Amman, Jordan (Downtown area)
UPDATE branches 
SET latitude = 31.9539, 
    longitude = 35.9106,
    address_en = 'Downtown, Amman, Jordan'
WHERE id = 1;
```

**Option 2: Check existing branches**
```sql
SELECT id, title_en, latitude, longitude, address_en 
FROM branches 
WHERE is_active = 1;
```

### Common Jordan City Coordinates

| City | Latitude | Longitude |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Amman (Downtown) | 31.9539 | 35.9106 |
| Amman (Sweifieh) | 31.9394 | 35.8621 |
| Zarqa | 32.0608 | 36.0880 |
| Irbid | 32.5556 | 35.8500 |
| Aqaba | 29.5321 | 35.0063 |

## 📊 Expected Test Results (After Fix)

When branch is correctly in Jordan, you should see:

```
📦 Jabal Al Hussein (Downtown) Amman
   Distance: 1.23 km ← Should be < 5 km
   Zone: Within City ← Correct zone
   💰 Total Fee: 2.62 JOD ← Base 2.00 + (1.23 × 0.50)

📦 Sweileh Amman
   Distance: 8.45 km ← Should be 5-15 km
   Zone: City Outskirts ← Correct zone
   💰 Total Fee: 9.84 JOD ← Base 3.50 + (8.45 × 0.75)

📦 Irbid Irbid
   Distance: 72.34 km ← Should be 70-85 km
   Zone: Extended Area ← Correct zone  
   💰 Total Fee: 98.43 JOD ← Base 8.00 + (72.34 × 1.25)
```

### Free Shipping Should Work:
```
Order Amount │ Delivery Fee │ Status
─────────────┼──────────────┼─────────
         25 JD │        2.62 JD │ 💰 CHARGED
         50 JD │        0.00 JD │ 🎁 FREE (threshold met!)
        100 JD │        0.00 JD │ 🎁 FREE
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Fix Branch Coordinates
```sql
UPDATE branches SET latitude = 31.9539, longitude = 35.9106 WHERE id = 1;
```

### Step 2: Run Test
```bash
cd backend-api
node test-delivery-calculation.js
```

### Step 3: Verify Results
Check that:
- ✅ Distances make sense (close locations < 10km, far > 50km)
- ✅ Zones assigned correctly based on distance
- ✅ Fees increase with distance
- ✅ Free shipping applies when order exceeds threshold
- ✅ No errors in calculation

## 🔍 What Each Test Checks

### ✅ Calculation Accuracy
- Haversine distance formula
- Zone matching based on distance ranges
- Fee formula: `base + (distance × rate)`
- Distance capping at 100km max

### ✅ Business Logic
- Free shipping thresholds
- Order amount impact on delivery fee
- Zone-specific pricing
- Branch-specific overrides (if configured)

### ✅ System Integration
- Database connectivity
- Shipping service functionality
- Branch coordinate retrieval
- Zone configuration lookup

## 💡 Tips

1. **Always run tests after:**
   - Changing shipping zone configuration
   - Updating branch locations
   - Modifying delivery fee logic
   - Database migrations

2. **Check for:**
   - All distances capped at 100km = branch too far away
   - All same fees = zone configuration issue
   - Errors = database or service problem

3. **Real-world validation:**
   - Compare calculated distances with Google Maps
   - Verify fees are reasonable for your business
   - Test with actual customer addresses

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### All fees are 5 JOD
**Cause:** Branch coordinates outside Jordan or no zones configured  
**Fix:** Update branch to Jordan coordinates

### Errors: "Branch not found"
**Cause:** No active branches with coordinates  
**Fix:** Add coordinates to at least one branch

### Errors: "No zones found"
**Cause:** Shipping zones not configured  
**Fix:** Run migration `010_enhance_shipping_zones_jordan_fixed.sql`

## ✨ Next Steps

1. **Fix branch coordinates** (if needed)
2. **Run comprehensive test**: `node test-delivery-calculation.js`
3. **Review results** - verify distances and fees make sense
4. **Adjust zones** (if needed) based on your business requirements
5. **Test in mobile app** with real checkout flow
